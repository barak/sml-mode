Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Should sml-mode be auto-loaded by default at your site?
 Emacs has no standard SML major mode, so it is generally a good idea to let
 emacs load sml-mode globally (i.e., for all users on this site).
 .
 If you answer no, people who desire to use it will have to put the string
 "(require 'sml-mode)" in their "~/.emacs" to load it.
